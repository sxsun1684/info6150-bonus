# Extra Credit Assignment — API-Based React App

## **Purpose**
This assignment allows you to earn extra credit points that can supplement the points you accumulated through your regular coursework on Canvas.  
It also consolidates the knowledge gained throughout the course into a small but functional project that you can later reuse as a learning reference or as demo material in your portfolio.


## **Task Requirements**

### **1. Choose a Free API**
Select any free-to-use API available on the internet.  

**Important:**  
Choose only APIs that **do NOT** require credit card information or sensitive personal data.


### **2. Build a React + TypeScript Application**
Your application must:

- Connect to the chosen API and retrieve data from it  
- Ask the user for input to interact with the API  
- Provide something useful, meaningful, or helpful to the user  


### **3. Publish Your App Online**
Publish your application using a **free** hosting + integration service.

- **Recommended:** Netlify  
  - You may follow the Netlify tutorial provided in class  
  - If prompted, choose the **Starter Plan**
- Netlify can automatically deploy your site whenever you merge to your `main` branch on GitHub.
- You may also choose alternatives like GitLab Pages, but support is not guaranteed.

The published page must:

- Use **semantic HTML**
- Have **good, accessible CSS**
- Be clear and usable to real users on the internet

You are encouraged to keep the implementation simple.  
A minimal, clean, functional app is completely acceptable.  
For example, you may recreate the **currency converter** we built in class.


## **Submission Requirements**

You must submit **two URLs**:

1. **The URL of your published app** (Netlify or another free hosting platform)  
2. **The URL of your GitHub repository**

Canvas only allows one text submission field.  
→ Add the second URL in the **comment section** of the assignment submission.


## **Evaluation Criteria**
(Almost identical to assignments 6, 7, and 8)

Your app must:

- Work correctly as submitted  
- Contain **no broken links**, missing assets, or console errors  
- Be evaluable **directly from the published website**  
- Contain **valid HTML and CSS**  
- Retrieve **live data from an API** — static data is **not** accepted  
  - Pages not using a real API will receive **0 points**
- Be publicly accessible on the internet  
  - Netlify automatically provides a public URL  
  - You do *not* need to purchase or configure a custom domain name

You have **unlimited attempts** until **one day before the class ends**.  
There is **no late penalty**.


## **Notes**
This assignment is marked *“does not count toward the final grade”* only so that Canvas does not penalize you for not completing it.

Your instructor will **manually apply** the extra credit points earned from this assignment to improve your final course grade.
